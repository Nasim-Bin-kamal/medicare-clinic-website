### Project Description

Our Clinic, an organized medical service offering diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventive outpatient services. Often, the term covers an entire medical teaching centre, including the hospital and the outpatient facilities. The medical care offered by a clinic may or may not be connected with a hospital.

The term clinic may be used to designate all the activities of a general clinic or only a particular division of the workâ€” e.g., the psychiatric clinic, neurology clinic, or surgery clinic. The entire activity when connected with a hospital is typically called the outpatient department, and the specific subdivisions may be referred to as clinics.
